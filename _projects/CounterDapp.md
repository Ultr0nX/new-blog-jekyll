**Code :** [github](https://github.com/Ultr0nX/simpleCounterDapp)

To Check this you need to have `metamask` installed in the browser .

We have two functionalities in it 
1. `Increment` -> increases the number by 1.
2. `Set Number` -> sets the number .

everytime you hit these buttons in UI , metamask pops up and does the TX 

**Tech Stack used**
- RainbowKit - to connect wallets
- next js 
- Wagmi & viem  - to interact with the contract
